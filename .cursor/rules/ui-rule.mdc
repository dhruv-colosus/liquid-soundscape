# 🎧 Fuzzler – Futuristic Music Player UI Instructions for Cursor AI

## 🌌 Goal
Design a **futuristic, fluid music player** that feels alive, modern, and immersive. Inspired by the attached screenshot and the following vision:

## ✨ Vibe & Styling
- **Dark theme** with subtle **glassmorphism** and **dynamic gradients**.
- Smooth, **liquid ripple effects** on interaction (buttons, album covers).
- **3D tilts** and **depth layering** for interactive UI.
- Animations should be:
  - *Organic* (fluid-like motion)
  - *Responsive* (hover/tap states should feel "alive")
  - *Tactile* (volume & seek sliders feel intuitive and silky-smooth)

---

## 🖼️ Main UI Elements

### 1. **Home Screen**
- **Central Carousel** of featured albums/playlists:
  - Albums are arranged with **3D depth** and rotate slightly as user scrolls.
  - **Scroll = swipeable**, like a conveyor with a liquid drag effect.
- **Text**: High contrast (light text on dark backgrounds).

### 2. **Album Cover Interaction**
- On **hover/tap**:
  - Enlarge slightly.
  - Add **3D tilt** and **subtle glow**.
  - Trigger **liquid ripple animation** behind the cover.

### 3. **Now Playing**
- Album art becomes a **spinning vinyl record** when music plays.
- Controls below use **glassmorphic cards** with soft blur & rounded corners.
- Progress bar is a **waveform animation**.
- Background gradients adapt to **album art colors** (dynamic theming).

---

## 🎛️ Playback Controls
- Position: **Bottom center or floating above the vinyl**
- Buttons:
  - Play / Pause → triggers **liquid ripple + bounce**
  - Next / Prev → **soft swipe with fading ripple**
  - Volume / Seek → show a **soft glowing gradient trail** on drag.

---

## 💿 Transitions & Animations

### Transitions Between Songs
- Swipe → ripple effect, fading out old album art, fading in new.
- **Vinyl drop** animation to play → record slowly lowers and starts spinning.
- **Ambient color shift** based on album art.

---

## 🔮 UX Highlights
- Everything should feel tactile, responsive, and satisfying.
- **Vinyl nostalgia** meets **space-age interaction**.
- Gesture support:
  - Swipe left/right for song change.
  - Tap-hold to preview track details.
- Custom cursor: subtle glow or trail (optional).

---

## 🧠 AI Instructions
- Treat this app as a blend of:
  - Apple Music fluidity
  - Spotify personalization
  - Retro vinyl nostalgia
  - Liquid, glassy animations

---

## 💡 Inspirations
- Glassmorphism UI kits
- Liquid button animations on Codepen
- macOS Big Sur blur effects
- Neon gradients from synthwave design
